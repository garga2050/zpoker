Z Poker â€” PWA web version (final)

Files included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- app.js
- manifest.json
- sw.js (service worker)
- assets/icon-192.png (placeholder)
- assets/icon-512.png (placeholder)
- assets/alert.mp3 (placeholder beep)

How to host (quick):
1. Create a GitHub repository (e.g., zpoker) and push these files to the root.
2. Enable GitHub Pages: Settings > Pages > Branch: main (root).
3. Or deploy to Vercel/Netlify by dragging the folder to their dashboard.

PWA / iPhone:
- Open the hosted URL in Safari on iPhone.
- Tap the share button and choose "Add to Home Screen" to install.
- For the install button in the UI to work, use a secure HTTPS host and open in Safari/Chrome supporting beforeinstallprompt.

How to replace alert sound:
- Replace assets/alert.mp3 with a short beep (200-400ms). Use same filename.

Customization/next steps:
- Replace icon PNGs with proper artwork (192x192 and 512x512).
- I can push to your GitHub repo for you if you give access (I will provide instructions for authorizing a GitHub App or using a personal access token). 

If you want me to push to your GitHub, tell me which option you prefer:
A) I give step-by-step instructions for you to upload and enable Pages (recommended).
B) I prepare a GitHub repo and provide a link you can "Import" or I can guide you to authorize minimal access so I can push (I will give explicit OAuth steps).
